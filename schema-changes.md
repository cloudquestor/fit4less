# Schema Optimization Changes

## Key Improvements

1. Removed redundant `user_workouts` table
   - User-workout relationship is now handled directly in the workout table via `user_id`
   - This simplifies queries and reduces joins

2. Added proper constraints
   - NOT NULL constraints where appropriate
   - CHECK constraints for positive values (sets, reps)
   - More appropriate ON DELETE behaviors

3. Improved data types
   - Changed weight and distance to DECIMAL(10,2) for precise measurements
   - Changed duration to INTERVAL type for proper time handling
   - Added proper timestamp fields for created_at and updated_at

4. Added sequence ordering
   - New sequence_order field in workout_activities to maintain activity order
   - This helps with displaying activities in the correct order

5. Added useful indexes
   - Created indexes on frequently queried fields
   - Added indexes for all foreign keys
   - Added index on workout date for date-based queries

6. Added audit fields
   - created_at and updated_at timestamps
   - These help with tracking record history

The migration script handles the transition from the old schema to the new one safely with:
- Data backups before changes
- Transaction wrapping for atomicity
- Data type conversions
- Integrity checks
- Sequence number generation for activity ordering
